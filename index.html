    Chickens
    <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
        junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern
        Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may
        be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult
        female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an
        immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant
        menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
        especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic
        fowl were typically used for this.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
        the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6]
        Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
