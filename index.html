    Chickens
    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
    junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern
    Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may
    be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult
    female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an
    immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant
    menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
    especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic
    fowl were typically used for this.
